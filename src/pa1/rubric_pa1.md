# Programming Assignment 1: Rubric

This assignment will be graded for a total of 10 points. You will be graded on the following:


* Correctness: Does your program produce the expected output and/or behavior?
* Syntactical Correctness: Does your code compile (i.e. can your code succesfully compile into Java bytecode, aka .class file)?
* Style: Does your code include required and/or optional comments? Is your code formatted for readability? 
* Structural Intent: Did you write your code according to the intent of the assignment? 

## Correctness (3 points)

Your code should produce the expected output, i.e. the Nursery Rhyme plus a properly written sixth verse. Use the "TestNurseryRhyme" class to ensure correctness. 

## Syntactical Correctness (1)

Ensure that your code can successfully compile. To check this, run the green cross icon on your JGrasp editor. 

## Style (1)

Ensure proper indentation of your code. Use an online Java formatter to check for proper indentation. Ensure that you include your name, date, class, assignment, and a brief description of what your program does at a high level. Put this comment block at the top of your file; use block quotes to do this. For example:

```java
/*

This program will print HelloWorld on the console.
*/

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## Structural Intent (5)

Does your code reduce redundancy? Does your code reflect the structure of the problem or behavior that you are trying to solve? Did you follow directions (i.e. you cannot use `System.out.print()` or other Java commands that we haven't learned) as specified in the assignment description? Did you "decompose" the general problem into smaller problems that are easier to solve (i.e. do you use static methods to reflect your decomposition of the problem)?
